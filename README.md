# Pomodoro Timer

This React application is a Pomodoro timer.

By default, the session timer is set at 25 minutes and the break timer is set at 5 minutes.

Users can edit the session length and the break length accordingly.

By clicking on start, the timer begins running.
By clicking on stop, the timer stops running.
By clicking on reset, the timer resets.

Once the session timer is over, the alarm rings and the break timer begins. The same applies vice versa.
